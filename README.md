### ðŸ‘‹ **Greetings!**

My name is **Roland**, I'm a 28-year-old software engineer.  
I work remotely from **France**, and I collaborate with numerous timezones.

### ðŸŒ± **About**

I value **trust** and **open communication**.  
I believe that being **honest** and **truthful** about skills and success -but also problems and issues- is the best way to achieve any goal.

I focus on:

- âœ… **Practicality**  
Putting the business need, the end-goal, or the end-user **first**.  
Keeping the original **vision** in mind.  
Focusing on reasonable steps, but build a solid final objective.

- ðŸ”„ **Consistency**  
Using the same set of tools, programming languages, or **versions** of a selected technology.  
Building using the same rules, same direction, same **vision**.  
Maintaining everything as **up-to-date** as possible.  
Following the **latest standards** and state-of-the-art.

- ðŸ’Ž **Minimalism and Efficiency**  
Keeping things **simple**.  
Not forgetting that time, resources and energy are finite. If it can be done using less, it should be so.  
Going the extra mile to find **the actual best solution** to a problem, and **challenging it** as often as possible.
